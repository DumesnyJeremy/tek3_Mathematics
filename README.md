## Module description
Operations Research Unit
Advanced scientific calculation algorithms

Operations research is the whole set of methods and models that allow numerous business management and organization problems to be clarified and resolved. The goal of this unit is to introduce a few of the important classic algorithms in scientific calculations that are used in operations research.

SUBJECTS COVERED:
The concept of the complexity of algorithms, graph theory, linear systems and programs and interpolation.

## Skills to acquire
You must demonstrate that you are familiar with, and know how to, apply complex mathematical algorithms. 
You will be evaluated on the completion of 9 mini-projects.

There are 3 themed skills in this unit:
1° Algorithmic: projects 301 305 307
2° Data structures (matrices/graphs): projects 302 303 304 306
3° Interpolation: projects 308 309

The following interdisciplinary skills will also be taken into account during the validation of the unit: precision, seriousness, punctuality, professional behavior.
Once these skills have been acquired, a grade assignment (from A to D) will, above all, depend on your implication in this unit. From A: very involved, to D: very little involvement.
